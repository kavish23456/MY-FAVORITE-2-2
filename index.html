        <p>I like skating because in skating you could travel at such a high speed and I think that every one in the future will skate rather than walk.It develops concentration levels and sharpens your thinking capacity.Regular exercises act as a key to mood-freshening. Skating plays an important role in removing the stress level and increasing your thought process. Thus, you can feel relaxed for the whole dayExercising in a regular manner makes you stronger. It improves your blood circulation level. It increases the immunity level to such an extent so that you can fight against any disease.
